### MIPS CPU

An implementation of the Raft distributed consensus protocol created by Sam & me.

* Follows the [specification](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf) of the Raft protocol in Elixir
* Uses Elixir to avoid concurrency bugs & awesome interprocess message passing

Provided a strong insight into the process of developing strong guaranteed distributed algorithms.
