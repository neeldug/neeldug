My contributions to Boa were made in the form of a few Pull Requests in order to achieve:

+ Better conformance with the ECMAScript specification
+ Migrate to a ReGex library, `regress` with a specific target for JavaScript regular expression syntax
+ Refactor the benchmarking system to be more modular and allow for easy comparison between other engines
